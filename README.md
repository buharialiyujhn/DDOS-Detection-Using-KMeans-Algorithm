# DDOS-Detection-Using-KMeans-Algorithm
The K-Means Clustering Project is an exploration of the K-means clustering algorithm, a powerful unsupervised learning technique used to identify natural groupings within data. This project delves into the core concepts of K-means clustering, including centroid initialization, iterative assignment, centroid update, and convergence.
